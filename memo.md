## Part1 Q1
PlonK
Groth16

## Part1 Q2
Users of the SNARK based network must rely on the fact that the trusted set up was performed correctly,but,STARKs use publicly verifiable randomness to create trustlessly verifiable computation systems.

## Part1 Q3
ZK-STARKs are more scalable in terms of computational speed and size when compared to ZK-SNARKs.
ZK-SNARKs are vulnerable to attacks from quantum computers due to the cryptography they use. ZK-STARKs are currently quantum-resistant.

## Part2 Q2.1
Input a, b and an output c. Use <== to check the value of c is the result of multiplying the values of a and b.

## Part2 Q2.2
Create a Trusted Setup while using a special encryption ceremony where participants perform calculations in turn.The final results of calculations are trusted as long as participant guarantees the safe disposal of the toxic waste.

## Part2 Q2.3
The first phase ceremony is the responsibility of the entire community
The second phase circuit-specific, and is the responsibility of individual teams.

## Part2 Q3.2
ERROR say "Non quadratic constraints are not allowed!" we must fllow quadratic constraints.

## Part2 Q4.1
PLONK does not require a specific trusted ceremony.

## Part2 Q4.2
Groth16 is best suited when performance is critical and many proofs need to be generated for the same circuit, while PlonK is best suited when many different circuits need to be processed at a reasonably high speed.

## Part3 Q1.1
32 is the number of bits the input

## Part3 Q1.2
"LessThan" library with two input values and returns the result.

## Part3 Q2.4
If we only want to check if the answer is correct, then it is satisfied if the columns, rows, and each box are declared as 1 to 9 with no overlap and the sum is the same.
